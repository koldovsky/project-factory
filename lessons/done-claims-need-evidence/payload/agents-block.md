### Lesson: done-claims need evidence pointers (done-claims-need-evidence, v1)

- Never write strong completion language ("Convergence reached", "all gates
  pass", "verification-only", "Overall result: Pass", "ready for release /
  sign-off", "done", "complete") into current-state.md, PR bodies, or handoff
  docs unless the same line carries a resolvable evidence pointer — a path
  that exists on disk (e.g. `docs/qa/automated-verification-latest.md`) and
  is fresh — or an explicit "Scope NOT delivered" section.
- The verdict belongs to exit-coded checks, not narrative. Field evidence:
  "Convergence reached … verification-only" was written while the same file
  admitted the formal acceptance was never run
  (2026-07-02-pixel-perfect-forensics.md, RC6).
- When you catch an unbacked claim, treat it as a correction event: file it,
  do not silently rewrite it.
